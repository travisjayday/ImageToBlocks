# ImageToBlocks
A Minecraft Spigot Plugin that lets you build realistic 2d block structures from an image

## Usage
General usage: Invoke the command, and give it an image URL and a scale factor. 
This tool downscales the image by the scale factor. Thus, if you have a high-resolution image, you need to scale it down a lot in order for it to fit in the Minecraft world. 
```
/img2blocks [URL] [Scale Factor (1-100)]
```

## Example
Builds an image of Lenna:
```
/img2blocks https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/7d/Lenna_%28test_image%29.png 20
```
